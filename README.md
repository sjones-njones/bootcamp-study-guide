# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 

This site was created to provide a place to organize and store all bootcamp prework notes. Through building this site, the most basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Github, and Gitbash were introduced. I learned how to troubleshoot and debug on the most basic level. I cannot wait to learn more.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used to help remind students about the topics learned during the prework course. It can be accessed throughout the course when needed. There are notes on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Gitbash CLI commands, and GIT. If DevTools console is opened, you can see JavaScript running due to the use of the console.log method. To view the console, right-click on the screen and select 'inspect' from the drop-down menu. This will open a panel on the right hand side of the webpage in the browser. Next select 'console' from the top bar. You will see a list of topics learned and it will randomly suggest which topic should be studied first.
